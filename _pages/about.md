I have been working in Algorithms research and engineering for the past 10+ years, I'm particularly interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (and the various methods and applications in which they are combined). I published several papers in those fields,  voluntarily taught DL and CV courses and peer-reviewed for top conferences and journals.
