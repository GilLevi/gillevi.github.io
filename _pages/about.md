I am an MSc graduate with honors, bringing over 15 years of experience in Software and Algorithms engineering. My expertise spans domains such as Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, NLP, and Medical Imaging. Throughout my career, I have held diverse roles from being a hands-on individual contributor to serving as a tech lead and people manager, leading projects from research to production.

I have also authored several academic research papers in these fields, amassing a combined total of more than 2,000 citations. In addition to my research contributions, I have voluntarily taught Deep Learning courses and have peer-reviewed for top-tier conferences and journals. 

My technical skills are vast, with hands-on experience in various frameworks and tools including Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, C++, git, and Linux. Furthermore, I am proficient with cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.
